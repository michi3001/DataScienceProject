# Air Quality Analysis - Data Science Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing air quality data using Big Data methods and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to explore patterns, predict pollution levels, and apply clustering methods to identify trends in air quality.

## Setup 
### Install Jupyter VS Code Extensions

### Virtualenv
Execute the following commands in the root directory of the project
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

```bash
virtualenv .venv
```

```bash
.venv/scripts/activate
```

```bash
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

### Select venv Python Kernel in the notebooks

## Dataset
We have chosen the **Diamond Dataset**:

## Objectives

### Data Preparation:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

### Supervised Learning:
- Implement a classification model to categorize air quality levels.
- Develop a regression model to predict pollutant concentrations.

### Unsupervised Learning:
- Apply clustering algorithms to identify patterns in pollution data.

### Visualization:
- Use appropriate visualizations to present insights from the dataset.

## Implementation

The analysis will be conducted using **Python** with **Jupyter Notebooks**
